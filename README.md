### **Explanation of Each File and Directory**

#### ðŸ“‚ `data/`
This directory holds all the data for your project. It's good practice to separate the original, untouched data from any data you modify.
*   **`data/raw/`**: Place your original, immutable dataset files here (e.g., `KDDTrain+.txt`). You should never modify files in this folder.
*   **`data/processed/`**: If your preprocessing steps are complex, you might save the cleaned and processed data here. This is optional but can speed up subsequent runs.

#### ðŸ“‚ `models/`
This folder is where you save your trained machine learning models.
*   **`svm_nids_model.pkl`**: This is the final output of your training script. Keeping it in a dedicated folder prevents it from cluttering your main directory.

#### ðŸ“‚ `notebooks/`
This directory is for your Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks are excellent for experimentation, data exploration, and visualization, but not for the final, repeatable code.
*   **`1-data-exploration.ipynb`**: An example notebook where you might load the data for the first time, create plots, and experiment with different features before writing the final training script.

#### ðŸ“‚ `src/` (Source Code)
This is the core of your application, containing all your Python scripts. The `src` stands for "source."
*   **`__init__.py`**: This empty file tells Python that the `src` directory is a Python package, allowing you to import scripts from it.
*   **`config.py`**: A configuration file to store constants and settings, like file paths or model parameters. This makes your code cleaner and easier to modify.
*   **`train.py`**: A script dedicated solely to training the model. It will load data from `data/raw/`, preprocess it, train the model, evaluate it, and save the final model object to the `models/` directory.
*   **`predict.py`**: A script to load your saved model from `models/` and use it to make predictions on new, unseen data. This could be adapted for real-time network monitoring.

#### ðŸ“„ `requirements.txt`
A plain text file that lists all the Python libraries your project depends on (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`). This allows anyone to easily set up the necessary environment by running a single command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Example `requirements.txt`:
Use code with caution.
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
joblib
Generated code
#### ðŸ“„ `README.md`
This is the front page of your project. It's a Markdown file that should explain:
*   What the project does.
*   The project structure.
*   How to set up the environment (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
*   How to run the project (e.g., `python src/train.py`).

### **How to Use This Structure**

1.  **Create the Folders**: Manually create this folder structure within your main `ml_nids_project` directory.
2.  **Place Files**:
    *   Put the dataset files in `data/raw/`.
    *   Write your training logic in `src/train.py`.
    *   Write your prediction logic in `src/predict.py`.
3.  **Run from the Top Level**: When you run your scripts from the terminal, always do it from the top-level `ml_nids_project/` directory. This ensures that the relative paths (like `data/raw/KDDTrain+.txt`) work correctly.

**Example command to run training:**
```bash
python src/train.py
